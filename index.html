        <p>When I was little, I loved working on electronic toys.<br>
          By the time I was in high school I made my own completely customized sound system for my car. I started learning coding languages like python and java. I went to a unity game design boot
          camp and made an FPS. I have recently become interested in machine learning, networking, and embedded systems. Embedded is everywhere, whether in a washing machine, bikes, or cars, and it's why I want to make a world where we are all
          virtually
          connected. Maybe not quite as drastic as “Ready Player One”, my favorite movie, but somewhere in the realm. I think designing sensors for vehicles to make our roads safer sounds incredible and hopefully something I can get into. I love to
          ski,
          bike, and go on all sorts of outdoor adventures. Oh, and I love beer. </p>
